# Power-BI-Portfolio
--My first portfolio in power bi--
I have taken the Adventureworks sales data model from Microsoft dataset. I have performed initial data cleaning using SQL and exported the resultsets in to a single excel file which contains three dimension tables (customer details, Product details, Date table) and one fact table (internet sales data). Created data model by creating One to many relationship cardinality between dimension and fact tables.After creating data model, I created dashboards which will show total customer base, top 10 spending customers, top 10 sale products, Monthly sales amount and sales by product catergoty details.Also created slicers through which we can apply filters based on customer city, product category & sub-category, Year and month.
